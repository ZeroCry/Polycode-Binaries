Polycode-Binaries
=================

Precompiled binaries of the IDE and Standalone framework for [ivansafrin/Polycode](https://github.com/ivansafrin/Polycode)

Right now I have releases for Win32, Linux-i686, and Linux-amd64. If you're looking for a Mac build check out [smokingbunny/polycodeMACbuild](https://github.com/smokingbunny/polycodeMACbuild) (not maintained by me)

There's nothing actually in this repository, just binary releases  
If you don't know what this means and just want a download click [here](https://github.com/suchipi/Polycode-Binaries/releases) and then download the .tar.gz or .zip appropriate for your platform.
